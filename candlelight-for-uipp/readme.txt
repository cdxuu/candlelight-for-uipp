Candlelight reskin mod for Pecca's Dragonspear UI++ mod

Author: cdx
Version: 0.2.0


Overview:

The Candlelight mod changes the color of Dragonspear UI++ mod interface. Most 
big elements are recolored. Smaller UI elements remain unchanged. It should 
look consistent enough, but it is not a full recolor.


Compatibility:

The mod should be compatible with any installation of Dragonspear UI++ v2.42 
from https://github.com/anongit/DragonspearUI/archive/refs/heads/master.zip 
(EE games 2.6) as it only changes the colors of some of its images. It 
doesn't modify in any other way Dragonspear UI++ or the base game.


Istallation:

Install Dragonspear UI++ mod first, then install the Candlelight (this) mod.
