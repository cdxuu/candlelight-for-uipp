Candlelight mod for Dragonspear UI++ mod

Author: cdx
Version: 0.1.0


Overview:

The Candlelight mod changes the color of Dragonspear UI++ mod interface. Most 
big elements are now lighter and mellower in tone. Smaller UI elements remain 
unchanged. It should look consistent enough, but it is not a full recolor.


Compatibility:

The mod should be compatible with any installation of Dragonspear UI++ v2.42 
from https://github.com/anongit/DragonspearUI/archive/refs/heads/master.zip 
(EE games 2.6) as it only changes the colors of some of its images. It doesn't 
modify in any other way Dragonspear UI++ or the base game.


Istallation:

Install Dragonspear UI++ mod first, then install this mod.
